## "A loan application fraud detection method based on knowledge graph and neural network"
This research article looked at the application of neural networks and knowledge graphs to spot fraud of a loan applicant based on their cell phone history. Their reasoning is that it is difficult to fake call history, and fraudsters could be in a shared network or participate in similar habits of calling many banks to apply for many loans. Our project focuses on the information provided by the loan application and doesn't use any additional information such as phone history. We also don't would likely just be using a neural network without the inclusion of a knowledge graph or Word2Vec like in this article. 

## "Artificial Intelligence Based System for Bank Loan Fraud Prediction"
In this research paper, the authors look at applying a neural network to a dataset including applications for bank loans and whether that applicant defaulted on the loan or not. They aren't very descriptive on their methods, but include information on the process of how they went through the data to use in training the neural network. In PPP Loan Fraud Detection, our data looks slightly different since the loan is either proven to be fraudulent or not. However, the information they include about ideal models could still be useful.
