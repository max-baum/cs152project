## Project scope

In our CS152 project, we want to explore PPP loan praud, and gauage the proficiency of a neural network in predicting (retrospectively) whether a loan was issued under fradulent premises given loan attributes provided by the Small Business Administration. As a note, this project will build upon work that Max's team did in a computational statistics class.

## Outline

The U.S. Federal Government Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) bolstered the U.S. economy and protected jobs through the lockdowns induced by COVID-19, but the program was also riddled with fraud.

Digital systems, including neural-network based systems, are increasingly utilized to prevent financial fraud.

This project will employ a custom-built dataset to test the efficacy of a neural-network model in detecting PPP fraud.

We expect there to be a range of challenges in the execution of this project.

Ultimately, we hope to develop a model that performs efficaciously on our dataset. We further hope that this model could one day help inform the investigation of PPP fraud and/or the development of IT systems that proactively gaurd against fraud in U.S. loan programs.
