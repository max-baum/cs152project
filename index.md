# Topline

In my CS152 project, I want to explore PPP Loan Fraud, and gauage the proficiency of a neural network in predicting PPP Loan Fraud. As a note, this project will build upon work that my team did in a computational statistics class.

## Background

The U.S. Federal Government dispersed nearly $700 billion in paycheck-protection program stimulus in 2020, to counteract the economic downturn caused by the COVID crisis.

It is estimated that roughly 10% of the loans were potentially issued to fradulent recipients, accounting for roughly $64b. Roughly $30b of potentially fradulent PPP loans remains outstanding. 

There is no singular public source of truth on PPP loan fraud, nor is there a single dataset that matches PPP loans to their identifying characteristics. Through a FOIA request, the SBA released a dataset of all PPP loans issues and corresponding attributes, but no indication of whether a loan was tied to fraud. In parallel, a law firm by the name of Arnold & Porter kept a tracker of fraud cases brought forth by the DOJ. Through a elaborate multistep process demanded by the disparate nature of the two datasets, Wonny, Earn and I "bridged" the two datasets such that we could annotated the SBA dataset by whether or not a loan was confirmed to be fraudulent.
