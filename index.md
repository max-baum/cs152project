## Project scope

In our CS152 project, we want to explore PPP loan praud, and gauage the proficiency of a neural network in predicting (retrospectively) whether a loan was issued under fradulent premises given loan attributes provided by the Small Business Administration. As a note, this project will build upon work that Max's team did in a computational statistics class.

## Outline

The U.S. Federal Government Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) bolstered the U.S. economy and protected jobs through the lockdowns induced by COVID-19, but the program was also riddled with fraud.

With a 

Roughly $30b of potentially fradulent PPP loans remains outstanding. 

There is no singular public source of truth on PPP loan fraud, nor is there a single dataset that matches PPP loans to their identifying characteristics. Through a FOIA request, the SBA released a dataset of all PPP loans issues and corresponding attributes, but no indication of whether a loan was tied to fraud. In parallel, a law firm by the name of Arnold & Porter kept a tracker of fraud cases brought forth by the DOJ. Through a elaborate multistep process demanded by the disparate nature of the two datasets, Wonny, Earn and I "bridged" the two datasets last semester such that we could annotated the SBA dataset by whether or not a loan was confirmed to be fraudulent.
